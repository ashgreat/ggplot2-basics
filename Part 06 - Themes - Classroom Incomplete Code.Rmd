`ggplot2` `theme` has four main components

1. Theme **elements** specify the non-data elements that you can control
2. Each element is associated with an **element function**, which describes the visual properties of the element
3. The `theme()` function which allows you to override the default theme elements by calling element functions
4. Complete **themes**


## Theme elements

There are around 40 unique elements that control the appearance of a plot. They can be roughly grouped into five categories: plot, axis, legend, panel and facet.

We will actively modify the `base` graph as we progress

```{r}

df <- data.frame(x = 1:3,
                 y = 1:3, 
                 z = LETTERS[1:3])

base <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  theme_minimal()

print(base)

```

### Plot background and panel

Both these elements are usually modified with setter function `element_rect`. Plot title and panel grid lines will be modified with `element_text` and `element_line` which I describe below when I discuss axes.

The syntax for `element_rect` looks like this:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Don't run this code

element_rect(fill = NULL, colour = NULL, size = NULL, linetype = NULL,
  color = NULL, inherit.blank = FALSE)

```

The options `color` and `size` pertain to the border around the rectangle.


```{r echo=TRUE}
base + theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}

base + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
base + theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "pink"),
             panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"))
```


Let's put a dark border around the plot

```{r echo=TRUE}
base + theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "pink", 
                                            color = "black", 
                                            size = 3)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"))
```


Change the `linetype`

```{r echo=TRUE}
base + theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "pink", 
                                            color = "black", 
                                            size = 3, 
                                            linetype = "dashed")) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"))
```


You can adjust the major and minor gridlines with `element_line` function

```{r echo=TRUE}
base + theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "blue", 
                                             size = 2, 
                                             linetype = "dashed"))

```

```{r echo=TRUE}
base + theme(panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "blue", 
                                             size = 2, 
                                             linetype = "dashed"))

```

For many professional applications it is important to set the aspect ratio of the panel so that the graph looks the same no matter where you print it. Flexible aspect ratio may lead to unnecessary stretching or compressing of axes.

```{r echo=TRUE}

base + theme(aspect.ratio = 0.75)

```


### Axes

Axes have two commonly used setter functions: `element_text` and `element_line`

The first is used for modifying all sort of axis text including axis title and tick text. The latter is used for the axis and tick lines. 

The synatx for the two functions is as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}

element_text(family = NULL, face = NULL, colour = NULL, size = NULL,
  hjust = NULL, vjust = NULL, angle = NULL, lineheight = NULL,
  color = NULL, margin = NULL, debug = NULL, inherit.blank = FALSE)


element_line(colour = NULL, size = NULL, linetype = NULL,
  lineend = NULL, color = NULL, arrow = NULL, inherit.blank = FALSE)

# where arrow describes the arrow head with the function arrow() with the following syntax

arrow(angle = 30, length = unit(0.25, "inches"),
      ends = "last", type = "open")
```


The default `ggplot2` doesn't have a line with arrow on the X or Y axis. Let's put it there.

```{r echo=TRUE}
base + theme(axis.line = element_line(arrow = arrow(angle = 15, 
                                                    length = unit(.15, "inches"),
                                                    type = "closed")))
```

Modify axis ticks

```{r echo=TRUE}
base + theme(axis.ticks = element_line(color = "red"),
             axis.ticks.length = unit(10, units = "pt"),
             axis.text = element_text(face = "bold", 
                                      size = 12, 
                                      angle = 30))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
base + geom_point(aes(color = z), size = 4) +
  theme(legend.key = element_blank(),
        legend.background = element_blank(),
        legend.title.align = 1,
        legend.position = c(0.9, 0.5))
```

Get `ggthemes` and `cowplot` and play with the themes

## Saving your plots

`ggplot2` has its own inbuilt `ggsave` function that we will use

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# vector graphics
ggsave("plot01_20190912.svg")
ggsave("plot01_20190912.pdf",
       width = 11.5, 
       height = 8.5,
       dpi = 600)

# raster graphics 
ggsave("plot01_20190912.png", 
       width = 11.5, 
       height = 8.5,
       dpi = 600)


```
